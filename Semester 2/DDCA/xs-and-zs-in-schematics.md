## Front
X's and Z's in Schematics

## Back
A node with value X is an error and means that it is illegal or unknown, usually happens when the node is pulled both up and down.
A node with value Z is neither pulled up or down and therefor floats. This is not necessarily an error. eg can be used for a tristate buffer.
