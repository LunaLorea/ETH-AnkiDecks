## Front
Conduction Complement

## Back
A CMOS Gate consist of a Pull-down and Pull-up network. To avoid shorts and floats we have to follow the Conduction Complement rule:
When PMOS Transistors Are in Parallel, NMOS Transistors Are in Series.
When NMOS Transistors Are in Parallel, PMOS Transistors Are in Series
