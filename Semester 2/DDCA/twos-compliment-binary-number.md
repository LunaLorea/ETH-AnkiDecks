## Front
Two's Compliment Binary Number

## Back
To represent a positive number just add a \(0\) as the MSB. To represent a negative number, invert all bits and add 1. To extend the number to more bits, simply copy the MSB until you have enough bits.
Advantages over signed numbers:
- just one \(0\): all zeros
- simple binary addition is possible.
Span:  \([-2^{N-1},2^{N-1}-1]\)
