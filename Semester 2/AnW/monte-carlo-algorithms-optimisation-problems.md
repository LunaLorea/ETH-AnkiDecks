Let A be a Monte Carlo algorithm for a maximization problem
as above and
\(Pr [A(I) ≥ f (I)] ≥ ε\) for some \(ε > 0\)
If we repeat A at least \(N = ε^{−1} \ln δ^{−1}\) times and answer with the maximum
of the results from all executions, the resulting algorithm will output an
answer that is not smaller than \(f (I)\) with probability at least \(1 − δ .\)
