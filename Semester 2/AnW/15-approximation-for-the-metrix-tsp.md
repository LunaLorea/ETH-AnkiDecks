## Front
1.5 Approximation for the Metrix TSP

## Back
Same as 2 Appr. but we change step two.

Instead of doubling each edge, we only double one edge for each pair of odd degree vertices.
2.1 Create complete subgraph with only the odd degree vertices.
2.2 Find minimal cost perfect matching \(O(n^3)\) has at most cost half of optimal solution
2.3 add matching to MST graph
