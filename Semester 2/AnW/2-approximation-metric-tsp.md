## Front
2-Approximation Metric TSP

## Back
1. Create MSP \(O(n^2)\)
2. Double all edges in MSP
3. Find Eularian Tour
4. Translate to cycle: use vertex order of Eulerian tour but skip visited vertices.

MSP weight is at most the optimal solution
Cycle uses each edge at most twice
-> 2 Approximation
