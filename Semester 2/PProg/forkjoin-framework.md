## Front
<dt>ForkJoin framework</dt>

## Back
<dd>Introduced in Java 7, this framework embraces divide and conquer 
parallelism. Tasks can be spawned (forked) and joined by the framework. 
The ForkJoin framework automatically automatically assigns these tasks 
(lightweight) to Java threads (heavyweight) and may also execute 
multiple tasks in one thread to avoid thread context switching overhead.</dd>
