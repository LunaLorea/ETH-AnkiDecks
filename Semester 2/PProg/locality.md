locality

## Back
<dd>
<div>Has several meanings in the context of parallel programming:</div>
<ol>
<li>Locally reason about one thread at a time (also known as thread modularity). Simplifies correctness arguments.</li>
<li>Data locality: related memory locations are accessed shortly after each other. Improves performance by optimal cache usage.</li>
<li>Code locality: straight-line code increases opportunities for instruction level parallelism</li>
