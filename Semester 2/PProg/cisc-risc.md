## Front
<dt>CISC, RISC</dt>

## Back
<dd>CISC (complex instruction set computer) and RISC (reduced 
instruction set computer) are two fundamental CPU architecture models. 
Classical RISC is easier to study, since simpler: e.g. RISC instructions
 can only work on registers, and reading/writing memory are separate 
instructions.</dd>
