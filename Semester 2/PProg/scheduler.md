## Front
scheduler

## Back
<dd>A management process, e.g. on the operating system level, that 
performs context switches. I.e. it interrupts/pauses/sends to sleep the 
currently running process (or thread), performs a context switch, and 
selects the next process (or thread) to run. Schedulers typically do not
 give guarantees when and how often they act, who gets selected next, 
etc.</dd>
