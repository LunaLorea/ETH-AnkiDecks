## Front
Synchronizes-with Order

## Back
The synchronizes-with order outlines the data flow between different threads: write actions that are synchronization actions, "synchronize with" actions that observe the changes. For example, if a thread observes a change in the value of a volatile field, the write action is related to the read action in the synchronizes-with order.
