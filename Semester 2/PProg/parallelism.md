## Front
parallelism

## Back
<dd>Doing multiple things at the same time (as opposed to concurrency: 
dealing with multiple things at the same time). Performing computations 
simultaneously; either actually, if sufficient computations units (CPUs,
 cores, ...) are available, or virtually, via some form of alternation. 
Often used interchangeably with concurrency. Parallelism can be 
specified explicitely by manually assigning tasks to threads or 
implicitely by using a framework that takes care of distributing tasks 
to threads.</dd>
