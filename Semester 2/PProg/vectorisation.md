## Front
vectorisation

## Back
<dd>Using special machine code instructions to execute a single 
operation (e.g. plus) on a chunk of data (e.g. an array segment). Can 
significantly improve performance. Code can be vectorised automatically,
 by compilers, or manually, by using intrinsics libraries provided by 
hardware vendors.</dd>
