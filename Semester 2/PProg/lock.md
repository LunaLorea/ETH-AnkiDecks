lock

## Back
<dd>In general, a token/resource that can be acquired by at most one 
thread at a time. Locks are typically provided by a programming language
 to enforce mutual exclusion, by guarding/protecting a critical section.
 A lock can be acquired/locked by a thread, and is then held until it is
 released/unlocked. In Java, each object can be used as a lock 
(intrinsic/monitor lock), but the JDK also provides more complex locks.</dd>
