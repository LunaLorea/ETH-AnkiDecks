<dt>context switch</dt>

## Back
<dd>Given a computation unit (CPU), a context switch denotes the action 
of switching the unit from one computation to another. Typically refers 
to switching between processes, but can also refer to switching between 
threads. Depending on the size of the context ("large" for a process, 
"small" for thread), a context switch might be computationally 
expensive, i.e. require comparably much CPU time.</dd>
