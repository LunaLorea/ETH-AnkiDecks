## Front
<dt>race condition</dt>

## Back
<dd>A program has a race condition if, during any possible execution 
with the same inputs, its observable behaviour (results, output, ...) 
may change if events happen in different order. Events here are 
typically scheduler interactions causing different interleavings, but 
could also be, e.g. changing network latency. Race condition is often 
used interchangeably with data race.</dd>
