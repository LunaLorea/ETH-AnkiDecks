## Front
<dt>abstractly atomic</dt>

## Back
<dd>A statement or instruction that, at a certain level of abstraction, 
appears to be executed atomically. E.g. from a caller's perspective, a 
method <code>synchronized append(x)</code> of a queue appears to append element <code>x</code> in one step, but from the queue's perspective, this might take several steps.</dd>
