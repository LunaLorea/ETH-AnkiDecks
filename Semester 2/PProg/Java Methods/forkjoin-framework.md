ForkJoin

## Back
<dd>Java Framework to allow easy divide and conquer implementations
Tasks (Threads) can be spawned (forked) and joined by the framework.

The ForkJoin framework automatically assigns these tasks 
(lightweight) to Java threads (heavyweight) and may also execute 
multiple tasks in one thread to avoid thread context switching overhead.</dd>
