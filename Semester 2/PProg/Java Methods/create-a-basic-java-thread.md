## Front
Create a basic Java Thread


## Back
1. Create a class which extends <b>Thread</b>
2. Overwrite the <b>run()</b> method without arguments. This is what gets executed on thread creation.
3. Create an object from that class and run the <b>start() </b>method to create a new thread.
The Thread will terminate when the <b>run()</b> method completes.
