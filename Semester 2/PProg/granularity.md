<dd>Coarse vs. fine: Splitting work into large tasks (coarse) reduces 
overhead, but might not use all available threads. Small tasks (fine 
granular) can be parallelized more, but also add more overhead. The 
trick is to find a "reasonable" size to minimize overhead and maximize 
parallelism.</dd>
