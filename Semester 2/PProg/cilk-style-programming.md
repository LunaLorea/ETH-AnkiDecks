<dt>cilk-style programming</dt>

## Back
<dd>Parallel programming idiom: To compute a program, execute code and 
spawn new tasks if required. Before returning, wait for all spawned 
tasks to complete. The system manages the eventual execution of the 
spawned tasks potentially in parallel. spawning and waiting on tasks 
creates a task graph which is a DAG.</dd>
