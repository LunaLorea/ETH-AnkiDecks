# ETH Anki Decks
## Getting Started
Just download the Anki apkg from the [latest release](https://github.com/LunaLorea/ETH-AnkiDecks/releases/latest) and import it into your Anki.

## Contribute
We use Ki to turn this Anki Deck into a git repo and back, so if you wanna make changes you need to install Ki

### Install [Ki](https://github.com/langfield/ki)

```
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/langfield/ki.git@main
```

See [Ki Documentation](https://langfield.github.io/ki/#cloning-a-collaborative-deck-from-github) to see how you can use this to push this repo into your anki or pull your changes from anki back into this repo.

If you find errors or want to share your additional notes, add them to your repo locally and make a pull request^^
