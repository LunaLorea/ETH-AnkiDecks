Proof System

## Back
A Proofsystem \(\Pi=(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{P},\tau,\phi)\) where
\(\mathcal{S}\) is the set of statments \(s\in\mathcal{S}\)
\(\mathcal{P}\) is the set of proofs \(p\in\mathcal{P}\)
\(\tau\) and \(\phi\) are functions
\(\tau\) is the truth function \(\tau(s)\rightarrow\set{0,1}\) if the statement is true
\(\phi\) is the verification function \(\phi(s,p)\rightarrow\set{0,1}\)if the proof is valid for the statment
