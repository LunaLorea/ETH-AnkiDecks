## Front
Quicksort

## Back
Complexity: \(\Theta(n^2)\) best case: \(O(n\log n)\) 
has a worse runtime than mergesort but uses less memory.
To sort the array the array is recursivly split into two sections where every element bigger than the pivot element gets swapped with one that is smaller than the pivot element. When all are on the right side the pivot element is swapped to the middle and both sides get revursivly sorted as well until the whole array is sorted.
